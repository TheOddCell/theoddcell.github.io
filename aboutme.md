I am a hobbyist programmer, who likes to make random things just for fun. I mainly use PHP, Python<sup>3</sup>, Bash, and HTML.  My main computer runs Windows 11 23H2.

<script type="text/javascript">
    var user = "me";
    var domain = "oddcell.ca";
    document.write('<a href="mailto:' + user + '@' + domain + '">' + user + '@' + domain + '</a>');
</script>
